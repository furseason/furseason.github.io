                      Our brand name is <strong>Fur Season</strong>. This is also directly incorporated into our brand logo,
                      which is the full brand name except the letter “a” is replaced with an animation of a dog and a leash wrapped around its neck,
                      as a way to represent the letter as much as possible.
                    </p>
              
                    <p>
                      In our journey to create a product that makes travel easier, cleaner, and more joyful for dogs and their humans,
                      we kept returning to one core idea: <em>every dog deserves to be part of life’s adventures</em>.
                      Whether it’s a quick trip to the park or a long road journey, our pets are family—and they deserve comfort, safety, and style on the go.
                      During our early research and interviews with dog owners, one word kept surfacing: “fur.” It’s everywhere—in the car, on our clothes, in the air.
                      It’s the lovable, fluffy proof of our pets’ presence. While some see it as a nuisance, we chose to embrace it as a symbol.
                      It represents loyalty, warmth, and the everyday chaos of loving a dog.
                    </p>
              
                    <p>
                      And then came “season.” Because to us, every season is dog season. Whether it's summer beach days, cozy autumn road trips,
                      or winter mountain getaways—our dogs are there. So why not make every season their best one yet? That’s how Fur Season was born:
                      a name that celebrates the messy, beautiful bond between humans and their dogs. It’s not just a brand—it’s a lifestyle built around shared adventures,
                      clean cars, and wagging tails. We don’t just sell dog baskets—we create smoother rides, safer trips, and unforgettable memories.

                    <blockquote>
                      “In a world where every journey is an adventure shared with your dog, we believe that comfort should move with you
                      because only then can every trip feel smooth and relieving.”

                    <h2>Visual Identity</h2>
                    <p>
                      All the elements of our visual identity are chosen carefully by keeping our target group in mind and the feeling we want to invoke in them when they see our brand.
                      For example, the font “Gloria Hallelujah” for the logo is deliberately chosen with the intent to create a playful, fun, and loose vibe.
                      This brings forward the carefree and adventurous side of our brand. The same thought process was given during the decision for the fonts on the website,
                      which are Capsuula and Boogaloo. Both fonts completely embody the friendly, bold, and cheerful vibe we want to convey to our target audience.
                      We want them to feel like they can rely on our brand to make their adventures very fun and amusing.
                    </p>
              
                    <p>
                      Since we put a lot of focus on the adventurous and comfort aspects, we decided to position different shades of green, orange, and beige into our visual identity
                      to fully encapsulate that feeling of nature and the outdoors lifestyle. Green of course represents nature, often causing people to recall trees, plants,
                      and open fields (London Image Institute, 2024). This ties back to the dog owners who love to go far away to explore nature, such as camping or hiking.
                      Orange was picked as it is often associated with warmth and playfulness (Patil, 2012), both aspects included in what we want to portray as it’s important
                      our customers feel comfortable enough to fully go out on their adventures. Finally, we decided to include beige to balance out the other two vibrant colours
                      as it provides a neutral look and feel to the palette and creates a sense of comfort and stability (Picsart, n.d.).

                    <h2>Supporting Visuals</h2>
                    <p>
                      As for the supporting visuals, we mainly used illustrations for the website that matched our colour palette and overall aesthetic.
                      We used drawings with light and delicate outlines to keep the peaceful and breezy vibe.
                      Then to keep the friendliness and spontaneous image going, we added loose and simple illustrations such as arrows and lines we saw on Canva
                      to decorate the website to draw more attention towards the presented content and to provide more clarity.
                    </p>

                <h2>1. Design elements</h2>

                <h3>FurSeason Colour Scheme</h3>
                <p>At FurSeason, we aimed to create a color palette that has functionality and fun — just like our product.</p>
                
                <p>Our main color is a calm, earthy green, <strong>#778c6a</strong>, used in our logo, homepage and as the background of this container. We selected green as our primary color because dogs see the world mainly in shades of yellow and blue, which together form green — making it the most dog-friendly color choice.</p>
                <p>To introduce a sense of warmth and playfulness, we complemented our main green with two inviting shades of orange and brown:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>#ce8758</strong> – a light, soft terracotta for friendly vibes</li>
                    <li><strong>#b15424</strong> – a deeper, richer brown-orange for boldness and energy</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We also added a gentle off-white (<strong>#ffecd9</strong>) to keep the overall brand feeling clean and modern, providing contrast while maintaining a natural look.</p>
                <p>For versatility and depth, we incorporated three additional green tones:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>#b9c384</strong> – light green for freshness</li>
                    <li><strong>#9eaf6f</strong> – a mid-tone for consistency</li>
                    <li><strong>#4f6f5b</strong> – a darker green for grounding elements</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These colors are used across our website and product design to create a cohesive and comforting visual identity. The off-white and green shades form the foundation of our brand’s clean, classy aesthetic, while the oranges add energy and fun — just like the joy of traveling with your dog (minus the mess). By combining nature-inspired tones with practical design thinking, we’ve built a visual world that reflects FurSeason’s purpose: making travel cleaner, cozier, and more stylish for dogs and their humans alike.</p>

                <h3>FurSeason Font Choices</h3>
                <p>For FurSeason, we selected a combination of three fonts that reflect our brand’s playful, pet-friendly identity while maintaining readability and consistency across the website.</p>
                <p>We started with our logo, where we used the font <strong>Gloria Hallelujah</strong>. This hand-written style font brings a warm, playful energy that fits perfectly with our brand personality. To add a unique twist and reinforce our identity, we replaced the letter “a” in FurSeason with a hand-drawn dog head, making the logo both memorable and meaningful.</p>
                <p>For the website design, we wanted a font combination that would complement the logo’s fun tone while ensuring clarity and balance. For the headlines, we chose <strong>Boogaloo</strong> from Google Fonts. Boogaloo has a bold, retro-inspired style that captures attention without being too heavy, adding a dynamic and friendly touch to key titles and page headings.</p>
                <p>To ensure smooth readability for longer texts and general content, we chose <strong>Capsuula</strong> as our body text font. Capsuula has a clean, modern look with rounded shapes that create a light and open feel — making it easy to read while still feeling unique and contemporary.</p>
                <p>Together, these fonts create a visual hierarchy that is engaging, consistent, and reflective of FurSeason’s core values: comfort, care, and a little splash of adventure.</p>

                <h2>2. Interface Patterns – FurSeason</h2>

                <h3>Homepage</h3>
                <p>To immediately capture the visitor’s attention, our homepage features a playful GIF of a happy dog enjoying a car ride — perfectly reflecting the vibe of a FurSeason road trip. The background uses our signature green color to introduce our branding.</p>

                <h3>Product</h3>
                <p>As FurSeason offers one main product in three sizes, we created a simple layout. Customers are presented with a clear image of the product, a short description, and the price. A dropdown allows users to easily select their preferred size (Small, Medium, or Large) before adding the product to their shopping cart. This setup makes the buying process quick and user-friendly.</p>

                <h3>Our Brand</h3>
                <p>Our values are integrated into a short, engaging text on the "Our Brand" page. We use our off-white background to keep things clean and classy while still letting our custom, playful illustrations shine. This page helps users understand our mission — offering comfort, convenience, and a clean travel experience for dog lovers.</p>
                <p>This page also introduces the people and Raf (our brand ambassador) behind FurSeason. We keep it simple and personal, using photos and very short descriptions. Each team member brings something special — from creativity to marketing and coding — and we highlight our dog ambassador as the face of the brand.</p>

                <h3>Navigation & Layout</h3>
                <p>The website is structured across five main pages:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Homepage</li>
                    <li>Our Product</li>
                    <li>Our Brand (includes our values and Meet the Team)</li>
                    <li>Corporate (for assignment purposes)</li>
                    <li>Contact Us</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We kept the navigation clear and consistent to ensure a seamless user experience. The homepage sets the tone, while each additional page supports our brand story and value proposition.</p>
                <p>The design embraces FurSeason’s playful yet classy personality. The combination of our custom color palette, quirky fonts (like Gloria Hallelujah and Boogaloo), and unique dog-themed graphics brings the brand to life.</p>
                <p>Our website design emphasizes the simplicity and practicality of our product — making it clear what we offer and how it solves a relatable problem, while speaking directly to our Gen Z and Millennial dog-loving audience.</p>

                <h2>Context of Our Product</h2>
                <p>
                    Our brand solves the problem of having dog hairs everywhere while travelling. We have designed a dog basket to put in the car. You can attach this basket to the car with seat belts. It has a plastic bottom to prevent the dog from scratching the car seats. The dog basket is made of suede, which is a fabric that attracts dog hairs. As a result, the dog hairs stay in the dog basket. It has removable covers, so it is very easy to clean.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our brand has a strong brand community. We use new, advanced technology and we have a unique design. Our product gives comfort, convenience, and quality. Never be annoyed by dog hairs in the car again. People can match the product with their vibe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before we are creating our website, we will promote multiple times a week on Instagram, TikTok and Facebook. This way, we will reach millennials and gen-z.
                </p>

                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>
                    Millennial and Gen Z Pet Parents in The Netherlands that love to travel and want to keep their car clean.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The platforms these people use are mainly Instagram, TikTok, Facebook. Our target audience contains of people that have dogs and that love to travel with the dog around the age 18–34.

                </p>
                <p>
                    We specify on Millennial and Gen Z Pet Parents living in The Netherlands. These people do not have children, so they have a pet. They take their dog with them to almost every occasion, if possible, also on holidays. They spoil their pet and buy anything for them. They love to post their pet. For this, they use Instagram and TikTok. Because they are on these apps, it is perfectly to promote our website and reach this target audience on these apps.

                <p>
                    The age range of 18–24 is the largest group that uses these apps (Zote, 2024). That suits Gen-Z. Also, these people are travel enthusiasts. They love to travel with their dog. Travel enthusiast could be of any age. For this reason, we do not only want to use Instagram and TikTok, but also Facebook. On this app, the average age is older. The largest age group is 25–34 (Zote, 2024). That average is higher than for other apps. With the use of Instagram, TikTok and Facebook, we are able to reach our complete target audience.
                </p>

                <h2>Communication Objectives</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>What communication objectives will you achieve? Reach objectives, Affect, Response.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    For our marketing campaign, we would like to reach around 20 to 50 unique visitors on the social media platforms we will be posting our content on. We are striving for an average number as this seems the most realistic goal for a start-up brand. Though the different websites (Instagram, TikTok, Facebook) do not guarantee similar potential in terms of reach across all of them, we still strive for 20 to 50 unique reaches for the advertising content we are planning to release.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Our KPI’s:</strong> 8,000 views within 6 weeks on TikTok, 1,200 views within 6 weeks on Instagram, 50–150 followers in 6 weeks (Instagram and Facebook combined), reach 25 people on our website (put the link into our bio)
                </p>
                <p>
                    The intended emotions we want to invoke in our target audience when they see our brand is that they feel seen, understood, and assisted for the seemingly unsolved issues they have had with their dog so far. Seeing our content should make them feel hopeful and eventually motivated enough to check our website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, the ultimate response we want from our target audience is that they feel curious enough to check out our social media accounts, viewing more posts we have posted. Further on, we strive for them to engage directly with our content. They can do this by liking, sharing, and commenting on our media content. Then after viewing our website, they feel driven enough to check out the products that are put up and eventually make a purchase, or even multiple purchases.

                <h2>Media Tactics</h2>
                <p><strong>We are using the following platforms:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Instagram: The age group on Instagram that is the biggest is 25–34, taking up around a third of the users.</li>
                    <li>TikTok: The age group on TikTok that is the biggest is 18–34, taking up around sixty percent of the users.</li>
                    <li>Facebook: The age group on Facebook that is the biggest is 25–34, taking up around a third of the users.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We are only using online advertising. Because we have a broad target audience of Millennial and Gen Z Pet Parents in The Netherlands that love to travel and want to keep their car clean, we will use these different platforms. We will use Instagram and TikTok to reach the Gen Z audience. We will use Instagram and Facebook to reach the Millennial audience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We decided to post on mostly Mondays and Thursdays for every social media platform. For Mondays, these will be around the 7 PM timeframe. As for Thursdays, we will be posting around 9 PM. It has been measured that these timeslots are the most effective when it comes to posting on social media platforms in The Netherlands (Radaar, 2025). Though, we are open to experimenting with different days and timeslots for posting to see what works best for our brand especially.

                <h2>Learning Points</h2>

                <h3>Instagram</h3>
                <p>
                    We intended to get 50–150 followers in 6 weeks on Instagram and Facebook combined. We wanted 1,200 views within 6 weeks on Instagram. We strive for 20 to 50 unique reaches for the advertising content we are planning to release.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We switched our Instagram account to a professional account after one week, which means that our first 2 posts are not included in our statistics.

                    We met our objectives for both followers and views. The evening posts performed better, and reels had the highest engagement. In the future, we plan to post more reels and maintain the evening schedule.
                </p>

                <h3>Facebook</h3>
                <p>
                    We posted the same content as Instagram. After 3 weeks, we had 48 followers on Instagram and only 1 on Facebook. The platform had little influence on engagement. Because Facebook was ineffective, we decided to stop using it in our campaign.

                    TikTok Week 3 showed that Raf-centered, humorous slideshow posts are our most effective format. The Raf stick meme had the best engagement, showing that lighthearted, mascot-driven content performs best. We will continue creating similar content in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Final TikTok result: over 4,000 views and 22 followers — short of our 8,000 view goal but still aligned with our follower goal when combined with Instagram.
                </p>

                <h2>Future Planning</h2>
  
                <p>
                    We learned that the posts that were posted around the evening got more views and likes than posts that were posted in the morning, so we continued to do that in the end for the last couple of posts. 
                    We also learned that it is better to post professional content on Monday–Friday, since people are more likely to see and interact with your post on these days. 
                    Additionally, reels get more views than posts. If we want to promote something in the future, we will create more reels.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We also learned that it is important to make your account a business account immediately after creating it, because now, we cannot see the statistics of our first two posts. 
                    We also learned that you get more followers if you promote your account. One way to do this could be to follow other accounts so they become aware of your page.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For TikTok, we learned a lot by simply experimenting — with formats, posting times, and posting days. 
                    We now know that for TikTok, it works well to post in the late afternoon or evening; morning posts don’t perform as well, unless the content is event-driven (e.g., April Fools post). 
                    We saw that slideshows work best, and consumers love bite-sized entertainment — casual, engaging, comedic, and emotionally uplifting content.
                </p>

                    We want to reflect on several aspects. Initially, we planned to consistently post on Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. However, due to low engagement and limited reach, we decided to discontinue Facebook and focus our efforts on the other platforms.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In future assignments, we could research more intensively, which might have shown us earlier that Facebook was not a successful platform for our target group.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Due to content planning and researching taking longer than expected with TikTok, we decided to begin posting actively in week 2. This issue could be resolved in the future by better planning and allowing broader timeframes to avoid timing issues.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Like Instagram, we only switched to a business account a little too late. This caused our analytics to be limited and not fully useful. 
                    For TikTok, we didn’t use any analytics because of this. In the future, we now know to convert to a business account immediately after account creation — a mistake we won’t repeat.

                <h3>Cost Structure</h3>
                <p><strong>E-commerce and website maintenance:</strong> We will have to host the website, create a design and keep it secured. Another cost is the payment processing fees and the customer support services. This needs to be maintained, so our product looks professional and trustable, but that costs money.</p>

                <p><strong>Product development and manufacturing:</strong> To support our high-quality production, we need high-quality materials for our products. Think of scratch resistant plastic. We need to research and develop the removable covers. After that, we have to do prototyping, testing and quality assurance of the product.

                <p><strong>Fixed Costs:</strong> Website domain and hosting fees Brand development (logos, trademarking, etc.) E-commerce and Website Maintenance Website hosting and design fees Security and maintenance costs</p>

                <p><strong>Variable Costs:</strong> Product Development and Manufacturing Cost of raw materials (e.g., scratch-resistant plastic) Production costs per unit (factory costs, labor per unit)</p>

                <h3>Cost per Unit Calculation</h3>
                <ul>
                <li>Fixed Costs: Suppose fixed costs are €50,000 per month.</li>
                <li>Estimate Variable Costs: Raw materials: €5 per unit Manufacturing cost: €3 per unit Payment processing (assuming 3% of €50 selling price): €1.50 per unit</li>
                <li>Total Variable Cost per Unit = €5 + €3 + €1.50 + = €9.50 per unit</li>
                <li>Calculate Cost per Unit: If you sell 5,000 units per month, then: 50,000 / 5,000 + 9.50 = 10 + 9.50 = 19.50</li>
                <li>Total Cost per Unit = €19.50</li>
                </ul>

				<h3>Interview conclusions</h3>  
				
				<p>
                   After doing the problem interviews, we found that there were a lot of problems that people experienced while travelling. They mentioned that they had to stop often for toilet breaks, that the dogs are often too cold or too warm or that they experienced that the dog walked away a couple times. The problems that were mentioned the most frequently were about the dogs walking around the car, scratching the seat, taking dirt from outside into the car and losing fur that is all over the car. This is why in our business plan, we decided to create a product that solves all these problems at once. We created a dog basket that gives the dog a comfortable and safe space in the car that prevents to do from damaging the car or making the car dirty.  

                </p>
				<p>
                   After the solution interviews, we recognized that the dog owners were content with the idea of the product, and most of them said they would purchase it. For this reason, we did not change that much about our product, and we continued this project with our idea.
                </p>
